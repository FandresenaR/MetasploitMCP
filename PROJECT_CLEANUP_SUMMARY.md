# 🧹 Project Cleanup Summary

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Branch**: main

## 📋 Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive cleanup and documentation update performed on the MetasploitMCP project.

---

## ✅ Actions Completed

### 1. Removed Redundant Files

The following temporary/duplicate markdown files were removed:

- ❌ `RESUME_COMPLET.md` - French duplicate of deployment information
- ❌ `DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md` - Temporary success message after initial deployment
- ❌ `DEPLOYMENT_INFO.md` - Redundant Fly.io information (consolidated into other docs)
- ❌ `MSFRPCD_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - Temporary completion message

**Rationale**: These files were created during initial setup/deployment and contained redundant or temporary information already covered in the main documentation.

### 2. Files Retained

The following documentation files were kept as they provide ongoing value:

- ✅ `README.md` - Main project documentation (significantly updated)
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide (expanded)
- ✅ `MSFRPCD_MANAGEMENT.md` - msfrpcd management reference (useful)
- ✅ `LICENSE` - Apache 2.0 license

### 3. New Files Created

- ➕ `CHANGELOG.md` - Complete project version history and change tracking
- ➕ `PROJECT_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - This document
